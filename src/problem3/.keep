1. Incorrect typings / any usage

getPriority accepts (blockchain: any).
→ Loses type safety, should be strongly typed (union of strings or enum).

2. lhsPriority is undefined

Inside useMemo → filter, the code references lhsPriority which doesn’t exist.
It should be using the priority of the current balance, but instead references a variable that isn’t declared → bug.

3. Inefficient + incorrect filter

Uses undefined variable (lhsPriority).

Logically wrong: it keeps balances with amount ≤ 0, instead of excluding them.

Repeatedly calls getPriority → wasted work (it will be called again in .sort)

4. useMemo dependencies are wrong

prices is not used inside useMemo → unnecessary dependency → causes extra recomputes.

5. Using index as key in React list

6. Formatting inside .map

toFixed() defaults to 0 decimal places, probably not intended.

Formatting could be computed inline when rendering instead of mapping a second array.

Creates a new array unnecessarily when it could be merged into rows.

7. Sorting inefficiency

Calls getPriority twice per comparison inside .sort. Could cache values.

Sorting happens even if no balances change (expensive on large arrays). Should be memoized only when needed.
